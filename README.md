## Description

The Tempo Worker charm provides a scalable long-term storage using [Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo).
This charm is part of the Tempo HA deployment, and is meant to be deployed together with the [tempo-coordinator-k8s](https://github.com/canonical/tempo-coordinator-k8s-operator) charm.

A Tempo Worker can assume any role that the Tempo binary can take on, and it should always be related to a Tempo Coordinator.

## OCI Images

This charm by default uses the latest release of the [ubuntu/tempo](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubuntu/tempo/) image.
