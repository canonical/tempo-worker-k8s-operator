# config

config:
  options:
    role-all:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: |
        Configure the application to run with all roles enabled. This is the default configuration. 
        This is a meta-role that configures the application to enable all other roles. Under the hood, the `all` role
        is mapped to Tempo's `scalable-single-binary`.
             
        Each Tempo application can only have exactly one `role-X` config set to `true` at any given time. 
        So if you want to configure this app to run with a role other than `all`, remember to set `all` to `false`.
        Invalid configurations will result in the component to stop working and the app to set blocked status.
        
        Note that for a tempo deployment as a whole to be consistent, each role 
        (except the optional 'metrics-generator') needs to be assigned to at least one worker node. If this condition
        is not met, the coordinator charm will set blocked status and the deployment will shut down.

    role-querier:
      type: boolean
      default: false
